This program is simple to use. It is a binary search tree that has 11 initial nodes. 
This program utilizes a multitude of functions:

The first one being a find node function, which finds the desired node. 
The second one being a remove node function, also self explanatory. This function removes the desired node from tree. 
After the node is removed, the tree will conclude with 10 nodes. 
There is also a binary search function as well. 

The final function displays the minimum and maximum value (node) within the tree.
