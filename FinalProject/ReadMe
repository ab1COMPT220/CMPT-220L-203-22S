This program is simple to use. It is a binary search tree that has 11 initial nodes. 

Read the following:

This program utilizes a multitude of functions:

The first one being a find node function, which finds the desired node. 
The second one being a remove node function, also self explanatory. This function removes the desired node from the tree. 
After the node is removed, the tree will conclude with 10 nodes. 

There is also a binary search function as well. 
Another feature includes all three traversing methods. 

And the final function displays the minimum and maximum value (node) within the tree.
